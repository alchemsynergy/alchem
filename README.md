# Alchem Desktop

##### An all-in-one inventory and accounts solution for Chemist shops (both wholesale and retail) as per new Indian taxation standards.

#### Why it is needed?

All the existing solutions don't have a good UI and UX, even getting used to those softwares take more than a month. Also, customer support is not at par.</br> This software being OpenSource aims to become more than just a software. It aims to become a community.

## How to build?

Project is typically made in Jetbrains Intellij IDEA, but can be migrated to any other IDE.</br>

#### Setup PostgreSQL for Alchem
 * Download PostgreSQL 9.5 or later.
 * Set password as `123456`
 * Open `pgAdmin` application
 * Double click on `PostgreSQL 9.5 (localhost:5432)` and type your set password.
 * Create new database
 * Restore the provided database.
 
#### Launch the application for IDE.
 
NOTE: Though project can be built and modified using other IDE, but same project structure has to be maintained while committed changes or raising pull requests.
